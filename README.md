# Transperth GTFS mirror

This allows us to keep the GTFS data from Transperth in a revision control
system (so we could look up historical data).

It should be trivial to adapt this to monitor another public transit system.

This is best used in a daily crontab.

You shouldn't need to run this script yourself though, I already provide a
repository at <https://github.com/micolous/transperth-gtfs>.  It has data
starting from April 2015.
